# THE MARSHAL

# day 0:
Deciding the main game to be coded
This game deals with finding a lot of new game Elements(clues) where the PC(marshal) would be the main player and he will not be helped by anyone and would be solving the mystery.

The mystery is:
There would be a gang of criminals who would have robbed a large sum of money from the major bank of a city and the marshal would be on his mission to search them. While searching them , he would find many new elements(clue) which will help him to catch the criminals and he will chase them.
